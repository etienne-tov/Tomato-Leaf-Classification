## Overview
This project aims to develop an image classification model for the detection of tomato leaf diseases. The model is trained to identify various diseases and the health of tomato plants by analyzing leaf images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from [Plant Village Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village). It includes images of tomato leaves categorized into multiple classes, representing different diseases and healthy leaves.

## Model
Our classification model is built using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. It achieves an impressive validation accuracy of 90% in identifying tomato leaf diseases, making it a valuable tool for farmers and agriculture experts.


## Future Perspectives
This project has significant implications for agriculture:
- Early disease detection for timely intervention.
- Optimization of pesticide usage.
- Integration into automated crop monitoring systems.
- Development of user-friendly tools for farmers.
- Collaboration with agriculture experts for customization.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to express our gratitude to the [Plant Village Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village) creators for providing valuable data for our research.
